KAP_Carrez (Ken Aurianne Paul) is a small application to check good property deals.

## What for ?

KAP_carrez is a school projet to learn about different web application architectures with the node JS technologie.

## How does it work ?

We use a simple bootstrap interface linked to a node JS server.
The nodeJS server analyse the webpage and send the intel on meilleursagents.com . Depend on whats the site resents us, we tell the user if the deal is a good one.
So basically it scans an url from leboncoin.fr and check on meilleursagents.com if the price fit to the market.

Example of url needed : https://www.leboncoin.fr/ventes_immobilieres/1076257949.htm?ca=12_s
